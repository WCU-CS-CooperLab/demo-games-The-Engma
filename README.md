Project 4
[Windows Client](https://github.com/The-Engma/GameDevQuizClient/raw/refs/heads/main/ChristmasQuizWindowsClient.zip?download=)

[Mac Client](https://github.com/The-Engma/GameDevQuizClient/raw/refs/heads/main/christmas_quiz_mac_client.zip?download=)

There are a few odditites with this project. Once someone playes a round of the quiz game, the server seems to die. It will require a restart.
In addition, the Mac client may not work. I do not have a Mac to test that with. Also, press the up and down arrows to toggle chat.
If all else fails, the source code can be found here.
