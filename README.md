Project 2 Phase 1: Use W, A, S, and D to controll the camera. Left Click to bring up the power bar. Click again when you have the power you want to shoot.

Project 2 Phase 2:
Element 1: The arrow now moves around the y axis along with the x axis, meaning the ball can be shot up into the air in 3d space.
Element 2: There are several physics changing blocks that alter the ball. They are:

Blue block: The blue block makes the ball go into zero gravity when the ball comes into contact with it.
It also makes the ball shoot much further and has dampening. The ball is also bouncy.

Red Block: This block makes the ball have super gravity when the ball comes into contact with it. 
It is almost always a bad thing to have super gravity so avoid these blocks.

Purple Block: This block makes the ball have antigravity when it comes into contact with it.
The ball will "fall" up instead of down.

White block: The white block returns the balls physics back to normal when the ball comes into contact with it.

Element 3: Space Theme
The game is called Space Golf, and the skybox has been changed to a copyright free picture from NASA.
The ball and special blocks have emissions turned on to make the game feel more futuristic.
The golf course tiles themselves have not been changed. It is still golf afterall.

Element 4: Title Screen: There is now a title screen that allows for repeat playthroughs when finishing the game.
